Henneken, Carolyn S. Grant,Donna M. Thompson, Roman Chyla, Alexandra Holachek, Jonathan ElliottHarvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, 60 Garden Street, Cambridge,MA 02138, USAAbstract. We discuss current efforts behind the curation of observing proposals,archive bibliographies, and data links in the NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS).The primary data in the ADS is the bibliographic content from scholarly articles in As-tronomy and Physics, which ADS aggregates from publishers, arXiv and conferenceproceeding sites. This core bibliographic information is then further enriched by ADSvia the generation of citations and usage data, and through the aggregation of exter-nal resources from astronomy data archives and libraries. Important sources of suchadditional information are the metadata describing observing proposals and high leveldata products, which, once ingested in ADS, become easily discoverable and citeableby the science community. Bibliographic studies have shown that the integration oflinks between data archives and the ADS provides greater visibility to data productsand increased citations to the literature associated with them.1. IntroductionThis paper discusses the current curation of archive bibliographies and their indexing inADS. Integration of these bibliographies provides convenient cross-linking of resourcesbetween ADS and the data archives, affording greater visibility to both data productsand the literature associated with them.The primary data curated by ADS is bibliographic information provided by pub-lishers or harvested by ADS from conference proceeding sites and repositories. Thiscore bibliographic information is then further enriched by ADS via the generation ofcitations and usage data, and through the aggregation of external bibliographic infor-mation. Important sources of such additional information are the metadata describinghigh level data products associated with publications, observing proposals from majormissions, the curated bibliographies for archives and organizations, and the sets of linksbetween archival observations and published papers.While ADS solicits and welcomes the inclusion of this data from US and for-eign data centers alike, the curation of these metadata is left to the archives which hostthe data and which have the expertise and resources to properly maintain them. Inthis regard, the role of ADS is one of resource aggregation and indexing, providinga lightweight discovery mechanism through its search capabilities. While limited inscope, this level of aggregation can still be quite useful in supporting the discoveryand selection of data products associated with publications. For instance, a user canuse ADS to find papers which have been classified in the bibliography for HST, Chan-dra, and Spitzer, which typically yields multi-spectral studies making use of data from12 Accomazzi et al.NASA\u2019s Great Observatories. Following data links associated with this collection ofpapers allows the user to directly download the data products themselves.2. Data Products Indexed in ADSIn the section below we describe how archives can provide to ADS the observationalmetadata which is then integrated in ADS\u2019s discovery platform. Collecting and sharingthis information provides the basis for the creation of bi-directional links between theADS and data centers, thus enhancing the discoverability of data and literature acrossAstrophysics archives.2.1. High-level Data ProductsImportant datasets are often described in \u201cdata\u201d papers, but are also typically avail-able in machine-readable format as digital surveys or electronic catalogs hosted by oneor more archives (think of the data products generated by projects such as 2MASS orSDSS). Additionally, the high-level data products associated with refereed papers cur-rently being published in the major astronomy journals are captured and ingested inrepositories such as Vizier, SIMBAD, or NED. Depending on the nature of the paper,these datasets might then become available as data collections which include electronicdata catalogs (corresponding to tables or plots in the paper), or other products such asimages and spectra (corresponding to figures).In order to facilitate the discovery of these data products, the ADS has been index-ing these records in its database since 1995, with an automated feed from Vizier since2001. Today, ADS has records for over 10,000 Vizier catalogs, making this the biggestcollection of high-level data products in our system. Once they become indexed inADS, these records gain greater visibility as well as the ability to be easily cited in theliterature. It is thanks to this arrangement that astronomers have been able to cite datacatalogs for over two decades, thus providing a simple (although incomplete) solutionto the problem of data citation.2.2. Observing ProposalsAbstracts for awarded observing proposals are useful additions to the content indexedin ADS for a variety of reasons. First and foremost, they provide early descriptions ofcurrent and ongoing science investigations being carried out by the observing facilities,making them more discoverable by the research communities. Observing proposalsalso provide a direct link to either existing or planned observations. Since there can be asignificant lag between the taking of the data and the publication of science results fromits analysis, the observing proposals are often the only descriptive science metadataassociated with the observations themselves.Having ADS records for these proposals means that they are not only easily dis-coverable but they become part of the scholarly record, and thus can be formally citedin the literature. While this practice is not (yet) mainstream, we note that there are over350 citations to observing proposals in ADS as of November, 2015. The ADS currentlyholds more than 32,000 records for observing proposals, including more than 9,000from HST. The ingest rate has been above 1,000 per year for more than 15 years.Aggregation and Linking of Observational Metadata in the ADS 32.3. BibliographiesThe ADS provides a way for users to view curated collections of records related to anumber of well-known astronomy institutions, projects and repositories. These collec-tions (commonly referred to in ADS as \u201cbibliographic groups\u201d) can be used as searchfilters (\u201cshow me all papers on AGNs which have data from the Hubble Space Tele-scope\u201d) or as browsable lists of papers (\u201cshow me all papers in the ESO telescopebibliography\u201d).The primary goal of such bibliographies has always been to facilitate the filteringof search results in the ADS, however the availability of paper-based metrics makes itpossible for archivists and program managers use them in order to assess the impactof an instrument, facility, funding or observing program. While this is an inevitableoutcome of the bibliography curation process, we urge caution whenever impact anal-ysis is performed using bibliographic data, and encourage users to read the \u201cfine print\u201dwhenever using and comparing paper-based metrics.It is worth pointing out that while there is now an emerging consensus withinthe astronomical library community about the principles behind these bibliographies(Lagerstrom 2015), there is no single (or simple) set of criteria which is applied acrossall such collections. To promote transparency about the process behind their creation,the ADS help pages provide a short description of the bibliographic groups.12.4. Data LinksLinks between bibliographic records and data products are a bi-product of so-called\u201ctelescope bibliographies\u201d (Accomazzi et al. 2012). In creating such a bibliography,the curator goes beyond the step described above of simply tagging articles associatedwith a particular mission or project, and instead identifies the particular data productsanalyzed in the paper. It is often the case that a paper will use a set of observationsfrom one or more archives, and therefore an archive\u2019s telescope bibliography needsto record the multiple mappings between a paper and a set of data products hostedby the archive. Similarly, an observation or derived data products may be featuredin multiple papers, so the telescope bibliography needs to support a many-to-manymapping between articles in ADS and its own datasets.Given the fact that the list of data products discussed in a paper can be quite long,the recommended approach for generating these mappings is having an archive exposeall data products associated with a paper in a single landing page, so that a unique linkexists between a paper and its data products within a given archive.Exposing the set of curated linkages to ADS is as simple as publishing a tablewhich correlates a bibliographic identifier (bibcode) with one or more correspondingresources hosted by the archive, with an optional label for the anchor text associatedwith each individual link. ADS periodically retrieves and ingests these mappings intoits index, updating the links in an automated fashion, and generating the correspondingbibliographic groups.1http://doc.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs_doc/help_pages/search.html#Select_References_From_Group4 Accomazzi et al.3. ConclusionsBeing able to read the literature and have access to the data discussed in the paper be justone click away is obviously of great convenience for the end-user, in addition to provid-ing evidence in support of the scientific arguments in the paper and the reproducibilityof its results. However, the integration and indexing of this information in ADS allowsits use to enhance the discovery process. In the introduction we provided an exam-ple query based on bibliographic group indexing which finds multi-wavelength papersappearing in NASA\u2019s Great Observatories bibliographies. A few additional exampleswhich use ADS\u2019s new search engine2 illustrate the kind of inquiries which become pos-sible once this information is indexed: literature-based topic searches constrained to aparticular collection (exoplanets and bibgroup:Spitzer); papers on a topic having asso-ciated data catalogs with particular spectral properties (exoplanets and vizier:infrared);or any combination of the two (exoplanets and (bibgroup:Spitzer or vizier:infrared)).Of course there are also direct benefits of this integration to the archives andprojects providing their data to ADS. First of all, by having a bibliography integratedin the ADS database, it becomes trivial to retrieve metrics associated with it and thusevaluate the scientific impact of its datasets as well as using bibliographic-based ana-lytics to gain insights on how the data is used in current research. However, the primaryreason for this activity is the scientific impact gained by having publications linked todata products. Studies by Henneken & Accomazzi (2012) and Dorch et al. (2015) haveshown a \u201cdata sharing advantage\u201d for papers which have links to data products, result-ing in higher citation counts. Similarly, data re-use increases upon the publication ofpapers studying them (Winkelman et al. 2006), leading to an increase in archival re-search (White et al. 2009). In other words, well linked-data is more heavily used, andwell-linked publications are more heavily cited, a win-win scenario, and the primaryreason to have well-described, well-curated data products indexed in ADS.Acknowledgments.
