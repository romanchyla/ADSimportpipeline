                              'text': u'Since the turn of the millennium a constant concern of astronomical archives have begun providing data to the public through standardized protocols unifying data from disparate physical sources and wavebands across the electromagnetic spectrum into an astronomical virtual observatory (VO). In October 2014, NASA began support for the NASA Astronomical Virtual Observatories (NAVO) program to coordinate the efforts of NASA astronomy archives in providing data to users through implementation of protocols agreed within the International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA). A major goal of the NAVO collaboration has been to step back from a piecemeal implementation of IVOA standards and define what the appropriate presence for the US and NASA astronomy archives in the VO should be. This includes evaluating what optional capabilities in the standards need to be supported, the specific versions of standards that should be used, and returning feedback to the IVOA, to support modifications as needed. We discuss a standard archive model developed by the NAVO for data archive presence in the virtual observatory built upon a consistent framework of standards defined by the IVOA. Our standard model provides for discovery of resources through the VO registries, access to observation and object data, downloads of image and spectral data and general access to archival datasets. It defines specific protocol versions, minimum capabilities, and all dependencies. The model will evolve as the capabilities of the virtual observatory and needs of the community change.'}],

In October 2014, NASA began support for the NASA \nAstronomical Virtual Observatories (NAVO) program to coordinate the efforts of NASA astronomy archives in \nproviding data to users through implementation of protocols agreed within the International Virtual Observatory \nAlliance (IVOA).   A major goal of the NAVO collaboration has been to step back from a piecemeal implementation of \nIVOA standards and define what the appropriate presence for the US and NASA astronomy archives in the VO should \nbe.  This includes evaluating what optional capabilities in the standards need to be supported, the specific versions of \nstandards that should be used, and returning feedback to the IVOA, to support modifications as needed.    \nWe discuss a standard archive model developed by the NAVO for data archive presence in the virtual observatory built \nupon a consistent framework of standards defined by the IVOA.   Our standard model provides for discovery of \nresources through the VO registries, access to observation and object data, downloads of image and spectral data and \ngeneral access to archival datasets.  It defines specific protocol versions, minimum capabilities, and all dependencies.  \nThe model will evolve as the capabilities of the virtual observatory and needs of the community change.   \n \nVirtual observatory; data archives; standards; IVOA; NASA \n1. INTRODUCTION \nFor more than a decade the astronomical virtual observatory effort has been defining protocols that enable users to \naccess data from providers throughout the world in nominally standardized ways.  A range of standards exist to enable \naccess to images, spectra, tabular data, resource metadata and more.  These standards are now sufficiently mature to \nsupport many science use cases, but there has been only limited work done in understanding how these standards can be \nmost effectively combined to provide comprehensive access to observatories\u2019 resources.  \nStandards development in the astronomical virtual observatory effort is coordinated by the International Virtual \nObservatory Alliance (IVOA) a consortium of 20 national organizations.  The IVOA establishes priorities and approves \nrecommendations for data formats, models and protocols.  There are now about 40 approved recommendations by the \nIVOA many with multiple versions. \nIn October 2014 NASA funded the NASA Astronomical Virtual Observatories (NAVO) program to provide continued \nsupport for the US Virtual Observatory infrastructure developed under earlier programs: the National Virtual \nObservatory (NVO) and Virtual Astronomical Observatory (VAO).  The four funded organizations in NAVO: the \nMikulski Archive at Space Telescope (MAST), the High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Research Center \n(HEASARC), the Infrared Science Archive (IRSA) and the NASA Extragalactic Database (NED), also committed to \ndefining and implementing comprehensive virtual observatory access to NASA astronomy data.  While each of the \ncenters has long been an active participant in the virtual observatory, NAVO\u2019s inception gave us the opportunity to step \nObservatory Operations: Strategies, Processes, and Systems VI, edited by Alison B.

We discuss our goals, the role of the specific VO standards used, the status and \nschedule for the implementation of this interface, and our plans to evolve to take advantage of new protocols and address \nnew science requirements. The NAVO archives\u2019 perspective is one of integration of VO protocols into existing and \nmature archive systems.  This can be more challenging than developing new archives in the virtual observatory since we \nhave a substantial legacy of resources that predate the standards and models developed within the VO.  \nIn this paper we have attempted to minimize the usage of VO jargon. Some terms do creep into the discussion and are \nindicated with bolding in the initial usage. \n1.1 History \nThe formal development of the virtual observatory protocols in astronomy can be traced to conferences at Caltech [1] in \n2000 and ESO/Garching [2] in 2002.  These conferences articulated a vision of a research environment in which the \nnominal host of data was of limited import, where astronomers could easily combine information from multiple sources.  \nThe discussions here were of the multi-mission and multi-wavelength science.  In 2002 the International Virtual \nObservatory Alliance [3] was founded to provide an international framework for the development of virtual observatory \nstandards.  Since its inception, its focus has been on defining standards.  Initial standards for data formats, simple \npositional queries and image queries have been followed by many more data access, metadata and data modeling \nstandards. .  Over the years there has been significant effort to work with scientists and client developers in workshops \nand summer schools creating a substantial literature for using VO protocols and tools (e.g., see [4]).  There has been a \ndeliberate effort to guide the IVOA\u2019s efforts towards emerging areas in astronomy: most recently toward support for \nmultidimensional and temporal data. \nThis focus on the needs of the research community, the clients of VO protocols, was not matched by comparable support \nfor the data providers.  While major astronomy archives adopted VO protocols as they were developed, there was limited \nattention to understanding how a mission should publish data in the virtual observatory.  For many years while VO \nprotocols supported the publication of some high level products handling the kinds of complex datasets that many \ntelescopes \u2013 and certainly most NASA missions \u2013 generate, was beyond them.  VO protocols can require substantial \neffort to adapt existing data to them.  The fluidity of some VO protocols could also be daunting with significant effort \nmade obsolete when standards changed incompatibly.  There was little guidance on how a fabric of VO protocols could \nbe woven to provide reasonably comprehensive mission support.  These concerns made it difficult for major institutions \nto develop a comprehensive strategy for data publication in the virtual observatory.   \nRecently the IVOA has approved protocols that enable support for the distribution of generalized data sets and has begun \nto focus more on details of extracting information from archives. It appears that there will be few disruptive changes to \nexisting standards in the near term.  It is in this context that the NAVO archives began a review of the implementation of \nVO interfaces to their data.  Our goal was to provide comprehensive and consistent access to NASA\u2019s astronomy \nholdings.  This assessment looked at approved and pending IVOA standards, the state of existing implementations at the \narchives, the costs of implementation of new capabilities and the needs of the astronomical community.  This paper \ndiscusses the results of this assessment, our belief that it is now feasible and appropriate to provide a comprehensive \ninterface to our data through VO protocols in a consistent way across NASA archives, and our progress in implementing \nthis interface. \n \n1.2 Scope and Goals \nNASA is one of the premiere organizations supporting research in the world astronomical community and its archive \nholdings include data ranging over the entire electromagnetic missions.  NASA missions and missions where it has \npartnered with European and Japanese counterparts are foundational elements of the today\u2019s astrophysics research.  \nFigure 1 illustrates the diversity of a few of the major datasets held by NASA.  NASA mission data are generally \nsupported by three domain archives:  The Infrared Science Archive hosted at the Infrared Processing and Analysis \nCenter (IPAC) is NASA\u2019s primary archive in the infrared, the Mikulski Archive at Space Telescope (MAST) is the \nprimary archive in the optical and near UV, and the High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Research Center \nProc. of SPIE Vol. 9910  99100A-2\n10000.00\n1000.00\n100.00\no\n10.00\no 1.00\na)\nCC\n0.10\n0.01\nNAVO archive\n+\nHEASARC\n+ ST\n+flanck IRSA\n+++++\n+ Spitzer -MIPS\n++ WISE\n+ + + Kepler GALEX\nMA+\n++OM/UV6T XMM -EPIC\nSS\nSwift-BAT\nSwift-XRT\nI I\n+ ++\nSpitzer -IRAC DSS/GSC handra\nFermi` AT\nI f I I I I 1 1 1 1 1\n9 12 15\nLog(Frequency[Hz])\n18 21 24\n \n \n(HEASARC) at NASA/GSFC is the primary archive for X-ray and gamma-ray data.  To enable the kinds of multi-\nmission, multi-wavelength studies that are the basis of much current research these NASA archives also host some key \nground datasets, notably the FIRST radio survey, and soon the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) and Catalina Sky \nSurvey (CSS).   The NASA Extragalactic Database (NED) has pioneered integration of data from myriad sources and its \nholdings are also included within NAVO.  The NAVO team works with other NASA and US data providers to ensure \nthat our approach is driven by the needs of the full US astronomy community.   In particular NAVO works closely with \nthe United States Virtual Observatory Alliance (USVAO) to ensure that when we assess standards we address not only \nNASA\u2019s needs but the requirements of the national astronomy community. \n \nFigure 1. Selected major datasets at NASA archives \n \nNASA archive data is diverse.  It spans more than 15 orders of magnitude in frequency.  Images\u2019 spatial resolutions can \nrange from worse than a degree to better than a tenth of an arc-second.   The time resolution may be hours or \nmicroseconds.   Data can be taken as scans, CCDs or photon events.  Files can be kilobytes or gigabytes in size.   \nProviding a common interface to such heterogeneous data is challenging but enabling astronomers to discover and \naccess our holding through standardized pathways can dramatically enhance the utility of our holdings and will increase \nthe research return on NASA\u2019s investment in astronomy.  One key challenge for NAVO archives is that the VO \ninterfaces need to work harmoniously with pre-existing interfaces.  Adopting VO standards de novo is quite different \nfrom ensuring that VO interfaces work properly in an existing mature framework. \nNonetheless providing such an interface is essential.  We are long past the era where the primary use of our data services \nis users logging into our systems and manually querying our tables and retrieving our files.  The NAVO archives each \nreceive tens of thousands to millions of queries daily the overwhelming majority of which are initiated by external \nProc. of SPIE Vol. 9910  99100A-3\n  \nsoftware clients.  Software tools can only interact efficiently and safely with our systems if there is a clearly defined \nprotocol for that interaction.  Many such tools are already built using VO standards and using simple query counts we \ncan already see that most of the our queries use these avenues.   Many powerful astronomy clients such as TOPCAT [5], \nAladin [6] and Iris [7] allow users to query and analyze data immediately using VO protocols.  More capabilities are \nmade available on the web or as command line tools each month. \nThese protocols are also increasingly built implicitly into our custom archive tools.  For many years our archive \ninterfaces have provided data in VO compatible formats, but looking just at the HEASARC we find VO interfaces are \nused to extract information from other NASA sites, to find and query remote catalogs and to allow users to perform \ncorrelations with remote data.  These VO dependencies are not visible to our users but they take advantage of them every \nday.   \nFor NASA\u2019s holdings to be effectively used in this world where software agents act on behalf of the researcher we need \nto publish our data using these community standards.  Note that in this paper we discuss almost exclusively the \nrequirements on data providers to publish data with only limited reference to client tools like those mentioned above. \n2. THE ARCHIVE MODEL \nThis section discusses our overall archive model, and then examines specific issues that we had to address as we have \nbegun implementing the model.  From the perspective of building VO services we divide the data holdings of the \narchives into three classes (recognizing that the boundaries between them are somewhat porous and ill-defined): \n1. Metadata describe our datasets and support the data process where users determine which datasets are of \ninterest.  These may be stored in a table or more complex hierarchy.  They are likely to be queried using a \nkeyword search or by specifying specific position, energy, temporal, or resolution constraints.  In this context \nwe are using metadata as what describes missions, instruments and the like not individual observations which \nare typically indexed using table data.  \n2. Archive data are datasets retrieved as files \u2013 including dynamically generated ones.  This includes Observation \nData that describe some aspect of the cosmos and can be used independently of the instrument used to take \nthem.  Often these will correspond to higher level (level 2 and 3) data, but can include data like raw CCD \nframes where positional information has been added to a header.  Examples include images, spectra, and time \nseries.  Note that the formats of these data may still be instrument specific and they may require special \ncalibrations.  Archive data also typically includes Instrumental data.  These are data whose primary utility other \nis simply supporting the analysis of specific observation data.   These include instrument calibrations, flat \nfields, housekeeping and orbit data and such. \n3. Table data are lists of objects, observations, proposals.  These are typically stored in relational databases and \naccessible through query interfaces where users retrieve rows that meet specified criteria.  For major surveys \ntables may be the primary science output of the survey. \nThe virtual observatory provides different protocols for accessing these kinds of data.  Metadata \u2013 at the dataset level \u2013 is \naccessed through the virtual observatory Registry [8].  Conceptually there is a single VO Registry which may be \ninstantiated at multiple sites.  The instances are defined by the interface not the underlying software so they are not \nnecessarily mirrors.  The different instances are synchronized so that users may query any Registry instance and get the \nsame result.  NAVO supports an instance of the Registry hosted at MAST.  Users can query the Registry using either \nkeyword queries or through SQL.  \nArchive data is currently primarily accessible through image and spectra data protocols, Simple Image Access (SIA) [9] \nand Simple Spectral Access (SSA) [10].  These protocols allow a user to query a dataset and find observations that \nmatch simple input criteria in position, time and bandpass.  Despite the names these protocols can also be used in \nprinciple to support datatypes like time series but we have not yet done so.    \nTabular data is accessed through two distinct protocols.  Simple positional queries \u2013 one query per position \u2013 can be \nmade through the Simple Cone Search (SCS) [11] protocols.  The Table Access Protocol (TAP) [12] is essentially an \nenhanced SQL interface so that queries can range from a simple search of an individual table to a complex join in some \nsophisticated schema. \nProc. of SPIE Vol. 9910  99100A-4\n  \nUntil recently the VO had few ways to describe instrumental data associated with an observation. However the recently \nadopted DataLink [13] standard allows the user to define any number of files or datasets associated with a specific \nobservation.  While there is a suggested vocabulary to be used in defining these relationships, users are free to extend \nthat as appropriate for a given mission.   DataLinks can be added to the data returned in most of the protocols above and \nthus enable the table protocols to be used to index archive data. \nUsing these building blocks the NAVO team has defined a standard model for publishing a mission in the virtual \nobservatory.  Figure 2 illustrates the approach.   The NAVO archives have agreed to implement this standard model for \nall major NASA holdings.   While Figure 2 summarizes how the main VO interfaces interact, it hides many of the details \nthat we have had to resolve to standardize the interface.  In the next few sections we discuss issues that we have had to \naddress in defining and implementing our interface at the NAVO archives. \n \nFigure 2. Overview of the Standard Model \n \n2.1 Issues in registry and metadata access \nPublishing data in the registry \nWhile the VO protocols provide a clear mechanism for users querying data after it has been added to the Registry, the \nmechanism by which data gets into the Registry is left more open.  Since the NAVO archive at MAST operates a \nRegistry instance and can manipulate the underlying database directly, adding MAST resources is straightforward.  This \ninstance also provides form interfaces that enable users to describe a few resources but become quite cumbersome when \nused for more than a dozen or so capabilities.  The HEASARC and IRSA both support many hundreds of VO resources \nand concluded that the only feasible way to populate the VO Registry was to build what is called a Publishing Registry \nin somewhat confusing VO parlance.  This is not a full instance of the VO Registry, but a tool that is intended to be \nqueried by the full instances to get the resources that a given institution wishes to publish.  Although in principle a \npublishing registry can be queried by users, it is intended only to be seen by the full VO Registry instances.   To inform \nthese instances that there is a new location to be searched, an entry must also be made in the Registry of Registries which \nis found from a link in the IVOA web site.  In principle this only needs to a URL to point the new publishing registry.  In \npractice, the Registry of Registries tests the new publishing registry for compliance to basic elements of the Open \nStandard Mission\nMission, Service and Content Metadata\nTables:\nObservations\nDetections\nObject lists\nCorrelations\nCone \nsearch\nPosition based \nqueries\nTable \naccess\nSQL and \ngeometric \nqueries of \nall tables\nRegistry\nKeyword match \nand SQL \nmetadata \nqueries\nArchive:\nImages\nSpectra\nCalibration\nHousekeeping\n...\nSimple image access\nProcessed images\nSimple spectral \naccess\nProcessed spectra\nTableLink\nVOSpace\nData Models\n(under \nstudy)\nOther data \ntypes and \nancillary data \nlinked to other \nresults\nProc. of SPIE Vol. 9910  99100A-5\n  \nArchives Initiative (OAI) interfaces that is used to query the publishing registry and to ensure that the data in the \npublishing registry matches the required schema. Setting up a publishing registry or full Registry instance is likely to be \nessential for any major archive. \nSupporting complex queries in the registry \nThe VO\u2019s initial protocols for querying the registry enabled only a small number of specific parameter matches, e.g., for \nthe wavelength regime or the publisher. The MAST instance of the registry also supported arbitrary keyword searches.  \nHowever searches comparable to the kinds of SQL queries users see in other databases were not supported.  In April \n2016, the NAVO registry added support for the new VO protocols which allow SQL queries of the registry.  The NAVO \nregistry now supports three kinds of queries:  matches against specified parameters, general keyword searches and full \nSQL queries. \n2.2 Issues in archive access \nSelecting protocol versions \nMany VO protocols are available in several versions.  Typically use of the latest version is appropriate but in some cases \nthe latest version is incompatible with existing implementations.  The primary concern currently is the choice of the \nimage access protocol to use.  Many NAVO resources are available through version 1 of the protocol, but version 2 \nallows users to discover data more effectively.  Our implementation plan is to finish providing services using version 1 \nof the protocol and then in coming years transition all services to supporting both versions of the protocol.  NED is \ndeveloping a version 2 implementation of this protocol this year replacing their existing version 1 interface.  The \nexperience gained there will be shared with the other NAVO archives. \nFully defining VO protocols \nThe relationships of VO protocols are complex.  As noted above, we plan to transition all of our image access \ncapabilities to use the version 2.0 of the IVOA Simple Image Access protocol.  However contrary to its name the \ndependencies of this protocol are complex.  It depends on specific versions of the VO data format, metadata and registry \nstandards and these in turn depend upon other standards.  Figure 3 is an analysis of the protocol dependencies of SIA v2.  \nStarting with the primary protocol document in red, each oval represents a document referred to by the standard either \ndirectly or through one or more intermediaries.  Feedback from this initial review by the NED team was incorporated \ninto the final revision of the document and helped resolve some ambiguities and contradictions.  Still understanding how \nto implement this standard involves a complex skein of interrelated standards.  Understanding this fully, and making sure \nthat we have defined exactly what we plan to implement, is a significant effort but necessary to ensure consistency \nacross the NAVO archives. \nImplementation of VO Data models \nMost recent VO data standards explicitly or implicitly depend upon adoption of a standard observation data model.  This \nObsCore model essentially defines the bounds and resolution of an observation or dataset in spatial, temporal and \nenergy axes.   The goal is to ensure that data can be discovered using standardized search methods.  In practice this is \none of the areas where it is much easier to define appropriate metadata for new missions and observations than to retrofit \nexisting resources into this new framework. \nThe VO data model does not always easily accommodate data from our missions.  It works best with discrete \nobservations with well-defined spatial, temporal and energy boundaries.  All-sky monitors, data with fuzzy boundaries, \nand continuous surveys do not always fit in comfortably.  Such datasets may need to be broken up into \u2018observations\u2019 in \nmore or less arbitrary ways.  This is not new with the VO.  The tiles into which the IRAS\u2019s continuous scans were \nbroken into for the IRAS Sky Survey Atlas are an historical example.  But it means that incorporation of non-traditional \ndatasets like the Fermi photon database requires some care. \nSupporting Instrumental Data \nThe initial drivers for the Virtual Observatory were strongly biased towards multi-mission analysis where the primary \ndata of interest was high level data with the instrumental signatures largely excised.  The VO image and spectral access \nprotocols catered specifically to these use cases.  However to get the most out of many mission datasets it is crucial to \nprovide access to detailed supporting instrumental data.  With the promotion of DataLink as a standard the NAVO \nProc. of SPIE Vol. 9910  99100A-6\nDocument Dependence for\nIVOA Simple Image Access v2.0 2015 -07 -30\nMU. 1.10600\nFlJEbat 20161123 / (C) CeOxl, 2015\n \n \narchives can now begin exploring providing access to the full complexity of space datasets to VO users.  Over the next \nseveral years as we begin to understand this interface VO interfaces will begin to access the full archive datasets \navailable at NAVO archives.  One key issue is the development of clients that that understand and utilize the links. \n \nFigure 3. Dependencies of Simple Image Access V2.0 protocol \nProc. of SPIE Vol. 9910  99100A-7\n  \n2.3 Issues in table access \nArchaic Protocols \nAs one of the oldest VO protocols, the Simple Cone Search mandates use of obsolete versions of some of the standards \nthat define the meaning of columns. While there has been some sentiment that the cone search standard should be \nimplicitly updated, a consensus has emerged that the cone search standard should be followed strictly.  Thus the result \nreturned by a query using the cone search protocol will be slightly different from that using the TAP protocol even when \nthey return exactly the same data.  In principle cone searches can be entirely supplanted by TAP queries, but we have \nchosen to continue to support this protocols since building clients is easier than for TAP. \nTAP organization \nThe VO Table Access Protocol enables clients to do queries of one or more tables.  NAVO archives have large numbers \nof tables and one choice that had to be made was how to publish these data in TAP.  Should separate services be \nprovided for tables or groups of tables or should we provide all tables at a given site within a single TAP interface? \nThe primary advantage for separating TAP services is to enable the metadata descriptions of the TAP service to properly \nindex its content e.g., we could have separate HST and Kepler TAP services, or even a separate TAP service for each \nHST instrument, where the Registry descriptions can then include quite specific mission information.  The advantage of \ncombined services is enabling correlations among the tables.  Users can look for regions of the sky seen in multiple \ninstruments or do correlations among object catalogs or combine the datasets in many other ways.  Given the scientific \nutility of these correlations we have chosen to create a single TAP service for each of the NAVO archives. \nIn principle then, we might have TAP services where we need to describe hundreds of constituent tables.   Discovering \nappropriate tables when a service provides hundreds or thousands of choices would be quite difficult.   The IVOA has \ndeveloped a solution where the metadata for each table is stored separately from the service that queries it.  Users find \nthe table of interest and are linked to the appropriate TAP service.  Each table is described independently as VO resource \nin the VO Registry.  If the table has position data it will often be associated with a unique VO cone search service.  \nRegardless the table is linked to a single TAP service that spans the NAVO site.  In practice most of these tables were \nalready indexed in our registry and we have simply added a link to these entries pointing to the NAVO TAP service. \nHandling complex geometries \nAnother area where TAP allows substantial discretion to the implementer is in the support for special geometry \nconstraints.  Since so many queries in astronomy are of the form \u201cfind data that is in this region\u201d, or \u201cwhere region A \nmatches region B\u201d, the query language that TAP services use adds special geometry functions to standard SQL.  In \nprinciple these functions can describe arbitrarily complex regions and can be used interchangeably with any other SQL \nfunction.  In practice doing so leads either to extraordinarily inefficient queries or to ones which are very difficult to \ntranslate into the backend server.  The NAVO archives have agreed upon a minimum level of support for the geometry \nfunctions and are working closely with the IVOA generally to develop agreed idioms for queries which ensure that the \nspatial indexing is effectively used.   \nThe primary limits to the queries are that the special geometry constraints are easily separable as distinct elements in the \nquery and that functions which in principle support arbitrary regions are restricted to basic circles and polygons (with \ngreat circle arcs).   This meets all of our common query use cases. \nSupport for table uploads \nTAP allows for optional table uploads where a user uploads a table that can then be used in further queries.  An obvious \nexample would be to upload a target list and then search a list of observations or objects for matches.  NAVO archives \nwill all support such uploads. \nHandling of large tables \nFor many of our most productive survey missions, e.g., WISE or GALEX, the primary output of the mission is a catalog \nof the objects detected.  There can be hundreds of millions or billions of entries in such catalogs.  One of the research \ngoals in NAVO is understanding how we can enable users to access these vast resources.  Missions like Chandra and \nHST have also produced very large object catalogs from heterogeneous observations.  All of these have proven to be of \nProc. of SPIE Vol. 9910  99100A-8\n  \nextraordinary scientific value. The NAVO archives are studying how to index these resources to enable the most \neffective querying and correlation capabilities.  This study is underway and is intended to produce recommendations for \nour common framework for ensuring efficient access to very large tables. \n2.4 Future plans \nWhile the plan for a common VO interface to the NAVO archives was included in the proposal for NAVO, the details of \nthis interface have been developed as part of the project and are subject to annual review.  In our first year the basic \ndefinition of the elements of the interface were defined, the gaps between our goals and current implementation were \nassessed, and a schedule for filling these gaps was determined.  In the second year, a clearer understanding of the \ninterrelationships of the VO protocols was achieved and services targeted specifically to fill in the missing interfaces \nbegan to come online.  In the next year most of the remaining holes in basic coverage will be addressed.  However we \nwill also being transitioning to more advanced VO protocols.  Three protocols that we have not yet fully incorporated \ninto the common model should be of particular interest as we re-assess the common interface this year: DataLink, \nObsCore and VOSpace. \nThe DataLink protocol allows us to associate a row of a table returned in any protocol with a set of one or more data \nproducts.  These products can be organized in a hierarchy.  This allows VO access to mirror the non-VO standards where \ndata tables index the archive content and full observation datasets, not just simple images or spectra, are returned. \nObsCore[14] is the core of the virtual observatory data model and will be gradually incorporated in the system to support \nthe newest version of the VO data access. \nVOSpace[15] addresses a new aspect of users\u2019 interactions with the archive.  As data volumes in archives and tables get \never larger, it behooves the archives to enable users to store intermediate results close to the data rather than requiring \ndownloads and the re-uploading data at every step.  VOSpace is the IVOA approach to cloud storage.  Over the next year \nwe are exploring how VOSpace may be used and whether alternatives such as WebDAV might be easier to implement \nand more effective for our users. \nUntil the present VO protocols have focused heavily upon the discovery of resources: dataset collections can be found in \nthe registry, the image and spectral access protocols return matching observations.   But the VO has provided relatively \nlimited assistance in the making data access easier.  If an image service returns a huge image, there is no standardized \nway to extract the small subset a user might be interested in.  Protocols that would enable the kinds of subsetting and \nfiltering that could make it much easier for users to access very large data are now under development in the IVOA.  \nThis effort is being carefully monitored by the NAVO team.  \n3. PRIMARY NASA HELD DATA SETS \nMany of the elements of our standard interface have been already be implemented or will shortly be available.  Table 1 \nshows the status of protocol implementation of almost 60 major missions and NASA-held data sets.   Datasets where the \nprotocol is available in June 1, 2016 are indicated by a check, 9.  If a mission cannot sensibly support a protocol (e.g., \nspectral access to an imaging mission), or for some older missions where the effort of retrofitting full VO access may not \nbe cost effective, a protocol may be marked with 8 which indicates that we do not do not currently plan to implement the \nprotocol for that dataset.   Otherwise the year when implementation is scheduled is shown.  Missions where NASA is the \nprimary sponsor are shown in bold.  Many smaller missions and datasets have been omitted. \nWe give a common name \u2013 usually an acronym \u2013 for each mission and the general spectral regimes covered.  A single \nmission line, e.g., HST or Spitzer, may incorporate many different datasets.  The subsequent columns indicate \nrespectively: the status of the registration of metadata; the ability to do simple positional queries of observation and \nobject catalogs associated with the mission;  whether image data is available through the VO; whether spectral data is \navailable and whether the mission tables are queryable through the standard TAP (i.e., enhanced SQL) interface.  \nMetadata and simple positional queries are available for all datasets, image access and general SQL query capabilities \nwill be almost universal by the end of this year (excluding non-imaging datasets of course).  While some missions \nalready have spectral access much more will be available by the end of next year.  Our plan has been to basically finish \nour first level of comprehensive access in the first three years of NAVO.  \n  \nProc. of SPIE Vol. 9910  99100A-9\n  \nMission Regime Registry Cone Image Spectra Table \n2MASS IR 9 9 9 8 9 \nAGILE X-ray 9 9 8 8 9 \nAKARI IR 9 9 8 8 9 \nAriel V X-ray 9 9 8 8 9 \nASCA X-ray 9 9 2016 2017 9 \nBBXRT X-ray 9 9 8 2017 9 \nBEFS UV/EUV 9 9 8 9 2016 \nBeppoSAX X-ray 9 9 8 8 9 \nBLAST Sub-mm 9 9 9 8 9 \nBOLOCAM Mm 9 9 9 8 9 \nChandra X-ray 9 9 9 2017 9 \nCOBE CMB/IR 9 9 9 8 9 \nCompton Gamma-ray 9 9 2016 2017 y \nCopernicus UV/X-ray 9 9 9 8 2016 \nCOS-B Gamma-ray 9 9 8 8 9 \nCOSMOS All 9 9 9 8 9 \nDENIS IR 9 9 8 8 9 \nDSS/GSC Optical/IR 9 9 9 8 2016 \nEinstein X-ray 9 9 2016 2018 9 \nEUVE EUV 9 9 9 8 9 \nEXOSAT X-ray 9 9 2017 2018 9 \nFermi Gamma-ray 9 9 2016 2017 9 \nFUSE UV 9 9 8 9 2016 \nGALEX UV 9 9 9 8 2016 \nGINGA X-ray 9 9 8 8 9 \nHEAO-1 X-ray 9 9 8 8 9 \nHerschel IR 9 9 9 8 9 \nHETE-2 Gamma-ray 9 9 8 8 9 \nHPOL Optical/IR 9 9 8 9 9 \nHST IR/Optical/UV 9 9 9 9 2016 \nHUT UV 9 9 8 9 2016 \nIMAPS UV 9 9 9 8 2016 \nINTEGRAL Gamma-ray 9 9 2017 2017 9 \nIRAS IR 9 9 9 8 9 \nIRTS IR 9 9 9 2017 9 \nISO IR 9 9 9 8 9 \nIUE UV 9 9 8 9 2016 \nKepler Optical 9 9 9 8 2016 \nMSX IR 9 9 9 8 9 \nNuSTAR X-ray 9 9 9 2017 9 \nPlanck IR 9 9 9 8 9 \nPPMXL IR/Optical 9 9 8 8 9 \nPTF Optical 9 9 9 8 9 \nROSAT X-ray/EUV 9 9 9 2017 9 \nRXTE X-ray 9 9 8 2017 9 \nSAS-2 Gamma-ray 9 9 8 8 9 \nSpitzer IR 9 9 9 2017 9 \nSuzaku X-ray 9 9 2016 2017 y \nSwift Opt/UV/X/g-ray 9 9 9 8 9 \nTUES UV 9 9 8 9 2016 \nUIT UV 9 9 9 8 2016 \nUSNO Optical 9 9 8 8 9 \nVela 5B Gamma-ray 9 9 8 8 9 \nVLA-FIRST Radio 9 9 9 8 2016 \nWISE IR 9 9 9 8 9 \nWMAP CMB/IR 9 9 9 8 9 \nWUPPE UV 9 9 8 9 2016 \nXMM-Newton X-ray/UV/Optical 9 9 9 2017 9 \nNED All 9 9 9/2016 2019 2018 \n \nTable 1. Implementation of VO protocols for NAVO datasets. \nProc. of SPIE Vol. 9910  99100A-10\n  \n \n4. STATUS AND PLANS \nSince its inception NAVO has collected statistics on the usage of VO protocols at each of the NAVO sites.  Even in \n2014, VO requests represented about half of the queries presented to the HEASARC archive and played a significant \nrole at MAST.  During 2016 VO usage at IRSA has increased dramatically so that currently most queries there are being \nmade through VO methods.  VO access at NED still represents a small fraction of total queries, but NED high level \nobject queries are not supported by VO protocols. Where there is a direct comparison, e.g., between NED SED services \nwhich are available through both VO and non-VO interfaces, the VO queries are comparable. \nIt is hard to quantify the science relevance of these numbers.  Small numbers of users making large numbers of queries \ndominate both the VO and non-VO query load.   Nonetheless the general trend seems to be that VO services will be a \nmajor and increasing fraction of our query load. \nWith the increasingly wide adoption of TAP and the prospect of general implementation of DataLinks the VO protocols \nare now powerful enough to enable full distribution of NASA data through VO protocols.  In our first 20 months the \nNAVO archives have defined and substantially implemented standardized data access to the major NASA astronomy \nholdings.  In the coming years we hope to build upon this foundation using DataLinks and the VO data models to not \nonly allow consistent and comprehensive access to our datasets but to simultaneously support access to the full mission \nholdings for each mission, and to enable completely mission independent queries of the NASA astronomy holdings. \nREFERENCES \n[1] Brunner, R.J., Djorgovski, S.G., Szalay, A.S., [Virtual Observatories of the Future], ASP Conference Proceedings, \nVol 225, Astronomical Society of the Pacific, San Francisco (2001) \n[2] Quinn, P.J., Gorski, K.M., [Toward an International Virtual Observatory], ESO Astrophysics Symposia, Springer-\nVerlag, Berlin/Heidelberg (2004) \n[3] Hanisch, R., Quinn, P, \u201cThe International Virtual Observatory\u201d, International Virtual Observatory Alliance 2003, \nhttp://www.ivoa.net/about/TheIVOA.pdf  (22 May 2016) \n[4] Graham, M.J., Fitzpatrick, M.J., McGlynn, T.A., [The National Virtual Observatory: Tools and Techniques for \nAstronomical Research], Astronomical Society of the Pacific, San Francisco (2007) \n[5] Taylor, M.B., \u201cVisualizing Large Datasets in TOPCAT v4\u201d, ADASS XXIII, ASP Conference Series 485, 257 \n(2014). \n[6] Boch, T., Oberto, A., Fernique, P., Bonnarel, F., \u201cAladin: An Open Source All-Sky Browser\u201d, ADASS XX, ASP \nConference Proceedings 442, 683 (2011) \n[7] Laurino, O., et al., \u201cIris: An extensible application for building and analyzing spectral energy distributions\u201d, A&C 7, \n81 (2014) \n[8] Demleitner, M, Greene, G., Le Sidaner, P., Plante, R.L., \u201cThe virtual observatory registry\u201d, A&C 7, 101 (2014) \n[9] Dowler, P, Bonnarel, F, Tody, D.,  \u201cIVOA Simple Image Access Version 2.0\u201d, IVOA Recommendation 23 \nDecember 2015 (2015) \n[10] Tody, D., et al., \u201cSimple Spectral Access Protocol Version 1.1\u201d, IVOA Recommendation 10 February 2012 (2012) \n[11] Plante, R., Williams, R., Hanisch, R., Szalay, A., \u201cSimple Cone Search Version 1.03\u201d, IVOA Recommendation 22 \nFebruary 2008 (2008) \n[12] Dowler, P., Rixon, G., Tody, D., \u201cTable Access Protocol Version 1.0\u201d, IVOA Recommendation 27 March 2010 \n(2010) \n[13] Dowler, P., Bonnarel, F., Michel, L., Demleitner, M., \u201cIVOA DataLink Version 1.0\u201d, IVOA Recommendation 17 \nJune 2015 (2015) \n[14] Tody, D., et al., \u201cObservatory Data Model Core Components, its Implementation in the Table Access Protocol \nVersion 1.0\u201d, IVOA Recommendation 28 October 2011 (2011) \n[15] Graham, M., et al., \u201cVOSpace specification Version 2.0\u201d, IVOA Recommendation 29 March 2013 (2013) \n \nProc. of SPIE Vol. 9910  99100A-11',
