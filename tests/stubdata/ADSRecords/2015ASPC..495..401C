                              'text': u"The ADS platform is undergoing the biggest rewrite of its 20-year history. While several components have been added to its architecture over the past couple of years, this talk will concentrate on the underpinnings of ADS's search layer and its API. To illustrate the design of the components in the new system, we will show how the new ADS user interface is built exclusively on top of the API using RESTful web services. Taking one step further, we will discuss how we plan to expose the treasure trove of information hosted by ADS (10 million records and fulltext for much of the Astronomy and Physics refereed literature) to partners interested in using this API. This will provide you (and your intelligent applications) with access to ADS's underlying data to enable the extraction of new knowledge and the ingestion of these results back into the ADS. Using this framework, researchers could run controlled experiments with content extraction, machine learning, natural language processing, etc. In this talk, we will discuss what is already implemented, what will be available soon, and where we are going next."}],

While several components have been added to its architecture over the past couple of years, this talk will concentrate on the underpinnings of ADS's search layer and its API. To illustrate the design of the components in the new system, we will show how the new ADS user interface is built exclusively on top of the API using RESTful web services. Taking one step further, we will discuss how we plan to expose the treasure trove of information hosted by ADS (10 million records and fulltext for much of the Astronomy and Physics refereed literature) to partners interested in using this API. This will provide you (and your intelligent applications) with access to ADS's underlying data to enable the extraction of new knowledge and the ingestion of these results back into the ADS. Using this framework, researchers could run controlled experiments with content extraction, machine learning, natural language processing, etc. In this talk, we will discuss what is already implemented, what will be available soon, and where we are going next."}],

The ADS platform is undergoing the biggest rewrite of its 20-year history.While several components have been added to its architecture over the past couple ofyears, this talk will concentrate on the underpinnings of ADS\u2019s search layer and itsAPI. To illustrate the design of the components in the new system, we will show howthe new ADS user interface is built exclusively on top of the API using RESTful webservices. Taking one step further, we will discuss how we plan to expose the treasuretrove of information hosted by ADS (10 million records and fulltext for much of theAstronomy and Physics refereed literature) to partners interested in using this API. Thiswill provide you (and your intelligent applications) with access to ADS\u2019s underlyingdata to enable the extraction of new knowledge and the ingestion of these results backinto the ADS. Using this framework, researchers could run controlled experiments withcontent extraction, machine learning, natural language processing, etc. In this talk, wewill discuss what is already implemented, what will be available soon, and where weare going next.1. IntroductionThe SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System (Kurtz et al. 2000) has gone through sig-nificant changes over the course of its 20 year career, but its purpose has always beento provide relevant information and services to the scientific community. The ADS hasachieved this goal through constant innovation and adoption of new technologies. Inthis paper we will describe the changes that are happening to the ADS in its recent in-carnation. They constitute the biggest rewrite in the history of the system and mark theopening of many new possibilities, particularly in discovery capabilities and supportfor bibliometric studies.2. Environment in which the ADS operatesThe ADS is an information system - built by and for scientists to provide access toscientific literature. Its user base is considerable, currently at any given time thereare \u223c 200 \u2212 300 active users on the website (which amounts to \u223c 1 million uniquesessions per month), although its core user base is much smaller (Kurtz et al. 2009).For the majority of these (anonymous) users worldwide the ADS is the destination theyreached after following a link from Wikipedia or Google to one of its records. Howeverfor about 50,000 scientists worldwide, the ADS represents a gateway to information,1arXiv:1503.05881v1  [cs.DL]  19 Mar 20152 Chyla, Romanthey use the system every day (or every other day). And for the ADS they are the userswho really care and need to be cared for.The ADS provides its services within a greater information space environment,which includes several service providers. One such providers is the arXiv, arguablyone of the most indispensable academic services, at least in the fields of astronomy andphysics. It has become a de facto publishing standard to post pre-prints on the arXivbefore they are available as published and reviewed papers through more traditionalchannels. However, as many things that we take for granted and expect them to bethere, the arXiv operates with a very limited budget and resources.The arXiv (and its volunteers, the scientists) performs the hard work of pre-filteringsubmissions and categorizing them. It does serve one purpose and serves it well, yetit needs other projects to complement it. One such project is the ADS, which closelycollaborates with arXiv, downloads and indexes every single arXiv submission - it isperhaps a little known fact, but you can use the powerful search capabilities of the ADSto sift through all arXiv fulltexts.Throughout its existence, the ADS has established such symbiotic relationships inorder to provide the best service to the scientific community. It collaborates not onlywith arXiv, but also with data repositories, publishers, and people behind production ofjournals and conferences, it has linked pre-prints to the published papers and other grey-literature, so that they not disappear into obscurity. Tracking the important channels ofscientific information logically led to demands for indicators of scientific contribution(the citation indicators) - which in turn get (mis)used as metrics of scientific success.Despite how we may look at it, these indicators remain important tools and the ADSrecognizes their importance. In addition to scientists, who come in their roles of re-searchers and readers, there are also administrators and evaluators, librarians, as wellas technocrats and grant agencies who use the ADS database for other, non-scientificpurposes. (Kurtz et al. 2005; Accomazzi et al. 2007)The reason we mention these diffeent user populations is to explain the context inwhich the ADS operates. It has to choose wisely which services are feasible to imple-ment and maintain. Given limited resources, this becomes not only a technological, butalso a sociological challenge.The discussion becomes simpler if we consider the entities (objects) processed bythe ADS. As an information system, the ADS primarily processes scientific literature,so the most frequent data types that it deals with are:\u2022 Preprints and journal articles: The ADS will store them in the database (theirfulltext content as well as attached objects such as extracted images).\u2022 Metadata: Metadata can be very expensive to create and curate but its use maybe surprisingly powerful. For example, if author affiliations are known, one cancompile cumulative reports about the scientific output of a certain institute, de-partment and/or university (even country or continent).\u2022 Citation information: Citing and cited by are very powerful pieces of informa-tion, they are the basis of the citation index and the metrics available throughoutthe ADS. Its use in the ADS is so important that in the new version of the searchengine it has been incorporated into the index, so you can search for citations inthe same way as you search for papers.ADS 2.0: new architecture, API and services 3\u2022 Usage information: This is information about readers, what they are reading,what papers are popular, downloaded, consulted and how often.1Finally, there is raw data, but in case of the ADS rather Links to science data.These consists of a network of links between bibliographic records hosted by ADSand data products, astronomical object, and electronic articles hosted elsewhere. Otherprojects (such as NED and the CDS) specialize in collecting this information and do amuch better job with it than what the ADS could do. The role of the ADS here is toserve as a gateway and make these resources seen and used.And what we mean by saying that is not just people who sit behind computerscreens looking at the ADS web interface - to the ADS developers those people aremorphing with the machines (robots) that start to access the new ADS infrastructure.This has nothing to do with de-humanization or other negative connotations of informa-tion processing. As far as information systems are concerned, it has become impracticalto treat users differently from machines. The differences between the humans and theclients (robots, programs, machines) that access the ADS on the users\u2019 behalf are disap-pearing, and this brings us to the new era and new architecture of the ADS. Since a fewyears, the system has been preparing itself for a change and it is not exactly evolutionbut rather revolution.3. New architecture and the APIWhile the old infrastructure of the ADS is similar to a huge building which hosts everydepartment and which has only one entrance (and only one power supply), the newinfrastructure is much more distributed and lightweight, more similar to a town withroads connecting different buildings. The central component here is the ApplicationProgramming Interface (API) layer 2 - we have split the internal subsystems into mi-croservices. They are independent, standalone web-services that communicate witheach other through the API using the REST and OAuth protocols (and soon also exclu-sively through HTTPS). Every service, even the ones that we consider the most critical,are connected to the API and available through it; can be accessed from anywhere onthe internet provided that the client has the proper authorization token.The micro-services are virtualized, currently running off the Amazon cloud. Theycan be scaled horizontally: if there is need for more power, we add computationalnodes to the cloud. Using this new organization, the ADS can more easily add newfunctionality (new services), and it is relatively easy to alter existing services. Ba-sically, implementations can be swapped at will, provided the semantics of the APIremains unchanged. It is still challenging to find the absolute minimal set of the API,but the system has already proven itself. It simplifies maintenance and allows for rapiddevelopment. 31This information is properly anonymized before it gets used by different algorithms and subsystems ofthe ADS.2The API layer is itself published on GitHub, at http://github.com/adsabs/adsws3As will be discussed later, this has also a negative consequences; at the moment, the ADS is changing sorapidly, that is hard to keep the documentation up to date. It requires certain mental discipline and robustpractices and we are still struggling to find the optimum balance.4 Chyla, Roman3.1. The searchThe core of the new ADS (similarly to the previous generation of the ADS) is centeredaround search. The search engine is built on a heavily modified and extended versionof Apache SOLR (http://lucene.apache.org/solr/). As one would probablyexpect, it has many advantages over the in-house custom search service developed forADS Classic 20 years ago. Unsurprisingly, it is able to address much bigger memoryspaces which translates into an ability to index bigger volumes of data. For the firsttime in ADS history, it is possible to search through fulltext content together with themetadata. Additionally, we have integrated the citation and co-readership networksinto the index, so you can now simultaneously explore all three different search spaces:metadata, fulltext content, and citations.The new search engine provides many features, some of which will be totally newto the ADS users, for example:\u2022 proximity search \u2013 ability to find a group of tokens based on their distance, e.g.body:(weak NEAR5 lensing), which finds phrases where weak appear within 5words of lensing. This query would find phrase \u201dweak lensing\u201d, as well as \u201dweakgravitational lensing\u201d in the fulltext\u2022 similarity search \u2013 (e.g. author:eisenstein\u223c 0.3) will find different spellings ofthe author name based on different similarity metric (this can be used to correctfor misspellings)\u2022 regular expressions \u2013 most often used by curators to find terms that follow aparticular pattern e.g. grant numbers or astronomical entitiesThe features described above are provided by the Lucene search library uponwhich SOLR is built. In addition, ADS has extended Lucene capabilities by imple-menting its own query language, modifying the traditional search syntax and enhanc-ing it with new search operators and modifiers. The main purpose of this dialect is tofacilitate communication between clients and servers. We do not expect normal ADSusers to know the specialized syntax, but we want to give them tools to execute complexqueries if they ever have a need to do so. More likely though, this query language willbe used by clients (programs) that search the ADS on behalf of users. To illustrate thepoint, here is a short list of a few specialized modifiers/operators:\u2022 =searchterm \u2013 the equals sign modifier is perhaps known to ADS users, it dis-ables the synonym expansion so that the search engine will not look for synonymsor alternate spellings.\u2022 references(author:einstein) and citations(author:einstein) \u2013 these are the opera-tors to retrieve papers that cite a collection of papers, or those that are cited bythat collection. Operators can be freely nested and combined with other terms,even if that means that you are going to analyze the entire ADS corpus, e.g.citations(references(author:einstein))\u2022 useful(), instructive(), trending() and other operators \u2013 the ADS search enginesupports so-called second order queries which use the citation and readershipnetwork to provide advanced search capabilities. Currently these operators usemultiple algorithms to retrieve papers that are most cited by papers on a topicADS 2.0: new architecture, API and services 5Figure 1. Screenshot of the new UI for the ADS, using normal search.(useful), citing the most relevant papers on a topic (instructive), or most read bypeople interested on a topic (trending). The ADS will be experimenting withdifferent implementations of these operators and will be adding more of them asneeded.The citation operators together with custom analytical functions are potentiallythe most fun part of the new search engine. It is possible to construct custom searchesjust for the purpose of supporting certain visualizations (e.g. a view of a co-readershipnetwork) or use cases (e.g. selecting the Nth token in an list of author names). In thefuture, we expect users of the API to come up with novel ways of using them, somethingwe did not anticipate when they were created. 43.2. Other servicesThe best example of the API in action is the new user interface for the ADS, code-named Bumblebee. It is a rich JavaScript client that runs in your web browser. It isthe future replacement of the ADS Abstract service, but unlike that one, virtually everyinteraction happens through the API. So without knowing it, when you visit http://ui.adslabs.org, you are automatically becoming an API user and accessing multipleweb services. It will not feel any different, but the difference in implementation issignificant: to have access to the API means that you are a first-class citizen of the ADSworld, accessing the same interface that ADS developers use every day.At the time of this writing, there exist multiple services besides search:\u2022 metrics: the familiar citation and usage reports (see 2), if you access the APIdirectly, you can download the data that are used to generate the metrics views(and build your own version of the visualization)4Of course we are aware that in order for this to happen we need to provide better documentation of thesearch functionality.6 Chyla, RomanFigure 2. Citation metrics report for the most cited 100 papers of A. Einstein.\u2022 visualizations: this service exposes different visualizations based on the relationsbetween authors and papers, e.g. word-clouds, paper networks, citation networks,and bubble-charts of search results (see 3).\u2022 ORCID: service that allows users to claim authorship through the ADS interfaceinto the ORCID database5Information on how to access and use the Api for these services, and any futureones, is available through: http://adsabs.github.io/help.4. Future directionsWe are aware that the new API has a number of shortcomings especially with respectto documentation. It is still a very young and relatively new component and it maynot be a smooth ride for external developers, but the ADS has already gone a longway in making this new \u201dmode\u201d available and will continue improving it. In the pastyear, the ADS has re-engineered many of its subsystems from the ground up (after afew false starts). The current implementation has shown that the system architectureis robust, and this gives us confidence to keep going in this direction. To offer a levelof stability to the platform, major changes to the API will be versioned so that wewill be able to provide backward compatibility to applications built on it. Our hope is5ORCID stands for Open Researcher and Contributor ID: http://orcid.orgADS 2.0: new architecture, API and services 7Figure 3. Paper networks inside the first 100 most cited papers of A. Einstein.that ultimately this open API platform will attract development from outside the ADSgroup, leveraging potential hidden in wider community.The new generations of astronomers and data scientists are technically very savvyand ready to embrace emerging technologies to conduct their research. We hope thatthey will appreciate the level of access the new API provides, and that they will takethe opportunity to build something that satisfies their research needs (and share it withother people). We hope that somebody will come up with ideas we did not have thetime or acuity to consider, new ways to explore the vast data indexed in ADS, or newways to connect existing systems and give insights that were not previously possible.We will continue building and adding more services, in the near future improving therelevancy of the search, and preparing the new user interface to replace the existingADS Abstract Service. Once the new user interface is rolled out, any new contributionsto it will become visible to at least a million users every month, which will hopefullyprovide enough usability data to test even more of the new ideas. Intrigued and want seemore or perhaps even build something? All of the code is published open-source andavailable through ADSs Github repo: http://github.com/adsabs.
